/* T116 loader-contract helper: "child" module.
 *
 * Models the real-world mscoreei.dll DllMain precondition: a private child
 * component DLL that refuses to initialize unless its parent module is already
 * loaded in the process. mscoreei.dll's DllMain calls
 * GetModuleHandleW(L"mscoree.dll") as its first required step and returns FALSE
 * (so LoadLibrary fails with ERROR_DLL_INIT_FAILED / 1114) when it is absent.
 * This reproduces that behavior without .NET, so the loader contract can be
 * asserted generally. */
