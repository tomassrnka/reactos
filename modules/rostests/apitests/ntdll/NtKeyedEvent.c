 * PURPOSE:     Tests for NtWaitForKeyedEvent and NtReleaseKeyedEvent: a timeout that races a release
 * COPYRIGHT:   Copyright 2026 Tomas Srnka <tomas.srnka@e2b.dev>
 *
 * A release that has paired with a waiter must make that waiter succeed, even when the
 * waiter's own timeout expired at the same moment. The pair then agrees on the outcome:
 * the call that was paired reports STATUS_SUCCESS on both sides, never SUCCESS on one side
 * and STATUS_TIMEOUT on the other. The same holds with the roles swapped, because a release
 * with a timeout waits for a waiter.
 *
 * The race is made on purpose: both threads run on one processor, the late party runs at a
 * strictly higher priority and spins past the other's deadline. The other thread's timer then fires
 * while it cannot run, and the late party arrives while the first is still queued.
