 * The precise interrupt time lives in kernel32 (QueryUnbiasedInterruptTimePrecise): programs reach it through
 * api-ms-win-core-realtime-l1-1-1, which resolves to kernel32 here, and a sandboxed process must not have to load
 * another DLL to resolve it. Both precise functions are forwarded there (kernelbase_ros.spec); it returns the unbiased
 * time (the interrupt time minus the sleep bias). QueryInterruptTimePrecise is forwarded there too, so it differs from
 * Windows by the bias, which the kernel keeps at zero; QueryInterruptTime above reads the biased time as Windows does.
