/*!
    \brief Measures the TSC frequency against the ACPI power management timer.

    Eight consecutive windows of 50 ms of the timer, each ended by a close
    read of the TSC and the timer (the closest of several reads), each give a
    frequency. The timer is polled, so late or lost interrupts do not matter.
    A pause between two polls longer than a wrap of the timer (4.7 s for 24
    bits) hides the wrap. Such a step between polls takes more than 1/16 of
    its window by the TSC (unless 16 steps of a window each hide a wrap),
    while the timer counts far less than its share. So a window is dropped
    when the TSC ticks per count of a step that takes more than 1/16 of it
    differ from those of the rest of the window by more than 1/8 (a pause the
    timer counted through agrees), or when that rest is under 1/4 of the
    window's count. This needs no other clock.
    A window that took more than twice or less than half the median TSC
    duration of the windows is dropped: a pause there could hide a wrap of the
    timer (4.7 s for 24 bits, nearly 100 windows long), and the TSC sees the
    pause whatever its rate. The result is the median of the remaining
    frequencies, and at least five of them must agree with it to 1/10000.
    As a second guard, a window longer than 4 s by the reference frequency
    (the RTC calibration, or the hypervisor's) is dropped and the result must
    not exceed it by more than 1/8 (lost RTC interrupts only make the RTC
    calibration higher, as a hidden wrap makes this one). Otherwise
    the measurement fails; without a frequency from the hypervisor the RTC
    calibration is then used, without counting lost clock periods.

       parts per million (the hypervisor's figure is the host's own TSC
       calibration, in kHz for KVM, and that can itself be off by more than
       0.1%), so its measurement is kept when it passes its own checks and

       errors. Otherwise the hypervisor's figure is used.
