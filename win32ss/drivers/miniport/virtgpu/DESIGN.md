# virtio-gpu 2D / modesetting guest KMD (XDDM) — Design Note

Ticket: GFX-02. Author: Tomas Srnka. Target: reactos-nitro (XDDM, VM-only).
Foundation for GFX-03 (3D / virgl).

## 1. Goal & scope

Drive QEMU's `virtio-gpu-pci` device from a ReactOS XDDM guest driver for:
proper (non-VGA) resolutions, a RAM-backed scanout framebuffer, and live 2D
output via virtio-gpu `TRANSFER_TO_HOST_2D` + `RESOURCE_FLUSH`. 2D works on a
GPU-less host (QEMU software path). No WDDM; no 3D here (that is GFX-03).

Reuse the already-shipped `sdk/lib/drivers/virtio` modern PCI transport
(`virtio_device_initialize` / `virtio_find_queue` / `virtqueue_add_buf` /
`virtqueue_kick` / `virtqueue_get_buf`) — the same lib netkvm uses.

## 2. Why this shape

ReactOS graphics is XDDM: a kernel **video miniport** (enumerate device, set
mode, own hardware) plus a **display driver** (GDI DDI: DrvEnableSurface, blits).
The existing generic `framebuf.dll` display driver already maps a linear
framebuffer and lets GDI render into it. virtio-gpu differs from stdvga/bochs in
one crucial way: the host does NOT continuously scan out guest RAM — the guest
must *explicitly* push updates (TRANSFER_TO_HOST_2D copies the dirty rect from
the backing into the host resource, RESOURCE_FLUSH presents it).

So the only thing missing versus a plain linear-FB card is a **flush pump**.

### Flush strategy (and why a miniport thread)
- XDDM `HwTimer` fires via `IoStartTimer` at ~1 Hz — useless for a display.
- A display-driver-driven flush (hook DrvBitBlt/DrvCopyBits/DrvTextOut, report
  dirty rects via a private IOCTL) gives true dirty-rect updates but requires a
  bespoke display driver.

MVP decision: a **miniport-owned flush thread** (`PsCreateSystemThread`) that,
at ~60 Hz, issues TRANSFER_TO_HOST_2D + RESOURCE_FLUSH for the active scanout.
This makes a *live desktop work while reusing the stock `framebuf.dll` unchanged*
(much lower risk), and decouples presentation from GDI. A full-screen 1080p flush
is ~8 MB * 60 Hz host-side memcpy — trivial for QEMU.
The private flush IOCTL + dirty-rect accumulator are implemented too, so a future
hooking display driver can shrink the flush region with no miniport change.

## 3. Module layout

    win32ss/drivers/miniport/virtgpu/
      virtgpump.c      XDDM video miniport (miniport.h/video.h world)
      virtgpu_core.c   virtio + DMA + GPU protocol + flush thread (ntddk world)
      virtgpu_vpwrap.h plain-scalar bridge: core -> VideoPort services
      virtio_gpu.h     virtio-gpu 2D protocol structs/constants
      virtgpump.h      shared miniport types / core API prototypes
      virtgpump.inf / virtgpump_reg.inf / virtgpump.rc / CMakeLists.txt

Display side: reuse `framebuf.dll` (wired via InstalledDisplayDrivers), exactly
like bochsmp.

### Why two translation units
`sdk/include/ddk/miniport.h` and `ntddk.h`/`wdm.h` both define `_INTERFACE_TYPE`
etc. and cannot coexist in one TU (verified by compile). The virtio lib's
`osdep.h` pulls `ntddk.h`; the miniport DDI needs `miniport.h`. Split:
- `virtgpump.c`: miniport DDI only. Device extension holds an opaque `PVOID GpuCtx`.
- `virtgpu_core.c`: ntddk + virtio only. Calls VideoPort services through thin
  wrappers in `virtgpu_vpwrap.h` that pass only scalar types (so neither world's
  heavy headers cross the boundary). Mm/Ke/Ps used directly from ntddk.

## 4. Device bring-up (HwFindAdapter / HwInitialize)

HwFindAdapter (miniport): `VideoPortGetAccessRanges` to capture all BAR ranges;
`VideoPortGetBusData(PCIConfiguration)` to read the 6 BARs + enable MEM + bus
master in the PCI command register (SetBusData).

HwInitialize -> VgpuCreate (core):
1. `virtio_device_initialize(&vdev, &VgpuSystemOps, ctx, msix_used=FALSE)` —
   does reset + ACK + DRIVER. Modern caps are parsed by the lib via our
   `pci_read_config_*` + `pci_map_address_range` callbacks.
2. features = `virtio_get_features`; negotiate `VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1` only;
   `virtio_set_features` (sets FEATURES_OK).
3. `virtio_reserve_queue_memory(vdev, 2)`; `virtio_find_queue(0)` = controlq,
   `(1)` = cursorq (unused for now). `virtqueue_disable_cb` (we poll, no IRQ).
4. `virtio_device_ready` (DRIVER_OK).
5. Read config (`virtio_gpu_config.num_scanouts`). GET_DISPLAY_INFO for the
   host's preferred size (logged; used to pick a sensible default mode).
6. Build the mode list (bochs-style resolution table, capped to <= 1920x1080
   and <= 8 MB so the per-mode contiguous backing allocation is safe).

### VgpuSystemOps (VirtIOSystemOps) mapping
- register r/w (`vdev_*`): VideoPortRead/WriteRegister{Uchar,Ushort,Ulong} on the
  mapped MMIO VA (modern virtio structures live in MMIO BARs).
- `mem_alloc_contiguous_pages`: `MmAllocateContiguousMemory` (+ zero);
  `mem_get_physical_address`: `MmGetPhysicalAddress`.
- `mem_alloc_nonpaged_block`: VideoPortAllocatePool(NonPaged).
- `pci_read_config_*`: VideoPortGetBusData(PCIConfiguration).
- `pci_get_resource_len` / `pci_map_address_range`: derived from the cached BARs
  (decode 64-bit/prefetchable, match against the PnP access ranges for length),
  mapped with VideoPortGetDeviceBase.
- `vdev_get_msix_vector`: VIRTIO_MSI_NO_VECTOR (polling, no MSI-X).
- `vdev_sleep`: VideoPortStallExecution loop.

## 5. Mode set (IOCTL_VIDEO_SET_CURRENT_MODE -> VgpuSetModeByIndex)

Teardown previous (if any): SET_SCANOUT(res=0) disable, RESOURCE_UNREF,
free old backing. Then:
1. w,h from the mode; stride = w*4; size = stride*h. Allocate contiguous backing
   (MmAllocateContiguousMemory), zeroed. resource_id = ++counter.
2. RESOURCE_CREATE_2D(res, FORMAT_B8G8R8X8_UNORM, w, h)  — matches Windows 32bpp
   BGRX in-memory byte order.
3. RESOURCE_ATTACH_BACKING(res, 1 entry = {backingPhys, size})  (contiguous =>
   single mem entry; SG/non-contiguous backing is a documented future step).
4. SET_SCANOUT(scanout 0, res, {0,0,w,h}).
5. Initial TRANSFER_TO_HOST_2D + RESOURCE_FLUSH (shows the cleared screen).
6. Start/enable the flush thread.

`IOCTL_VIDEO_MAP_VIDEO_MEMORY` (framebuf calls it after set-mode): the miniport
`VideoPortMapMemory`s the backing's physical range into the caller (win32k) so
GDI renders straight into the scanout backing (cached; x86 keeps it coherent for
QEMU's RAM reads).

## 6. Command submission (controlq, polled)

One reused command buffer + one response buffer (contiguous, PA known). Per cmd:
`sg[0]={cmdPA,cmdLen}` (device-readable), `sg[1]={respPA,respLen}` (device-
writable); `virtqueue_add_buf(vq,sg,1,1,tok,NULL,0)`; `virtqueue_kick`; poll
`virtqueue_get_buf` with a bounded VideoPortStallExecution timeout; verify the
response type is `VIRTIO_GPU_RESP_OK_*`. A KMUTEX serialises controlq between the
flush thread and mode changes.

## 7. Flush thread

`KeDelayExecutionThread(~16 ms)` loop; on each tick, if a scanout is active:
TRANSFER_TO_HOST_2D(rect) + RESOURCE_FLUSH(rect), where rect = accumulated dirty
rect from the private IOCTL if present, else the full screen. Signalled to stop
via a KEVENT at teardown.

## 8. Cursor

framebuf uses `EngSetPointerShape`; with no hardware pointer the GDI engine
composites the pointer into the primary surface (our backing), so the flush pump
presents it. Hardware cursor (virtio-gpu cursorq UPDATE_CURSOR/MOVE_CURSOR) is a
later optimisation.

## 9. Test plan

Boot nitro bootcd under QEMU with `-device virtio-gpu-pci` (software, no host GPU).
Verify on the serial log + VNC screenshot: device enumerates (VgpuCreate ok, caps
read), a non-VGA mode is set (e.g. 1024x768/1280x1024/1080p), the desktop renders
and updates live (mouse move, window drag), boot-smoke is clean. Compare against
the stdvga/bochs baseline (which tops out at VGA/bochs modes with no flush
semantics).

## 10. Known gaps / future (GFX-03 handoff)

- Contiguous single-entry backing (cap 1080p). Next: scatter-gather backing via
  multiple virtio_gpu_mem_entry pages to lift the size cap / reduce alloc risk.
- Full-screen flush by default; dirty-rect hooking display driver = the perf win.
- No MSI-X / interrupts (polled). Fine for 2D; 3D will want IRQ-driven fences.
- Hardware cursor via cursorq.
- EDID (VIRTIO_GPU_F_EDID) for host-driven preferred modes / hotplug.
- **GFX-03 builds on**: this transport bring-up, controlq submission, resource +
  backing model, and scanout. 3D adds VIRTIO_GPU_F_VIRGL, 3D resource create,
  CTX create, SUBMIT_3D, and capset negotiation on the same controlq, plus a
  WDDM-or-escape path for the GL UMD. The 2D scanout/flush remains the present path.

## 11. Results (2026-10-24, on vultr-kvm-1, QEMU 8.2.2, fork/main bbe9454)

**Working 2D/modesetting KMD.** Built into bootcd.iso; boots the ReactOS "Live
Environment" GUI.

- `-vga none -device virtio-gpu-pci` (the ticket's exact target, no VGA device at
  all): desktop renders at **1024x768** (non-VGA) driven entirely by virtgpump.
- `-device virtio-vga`: same, 1024x768.
- Device enumerates; virtgpump binds via CDDB; virtio modern transport brings up
  (polled, no MSI-X); controlq works; RESOURCE_CREATE_2D + ATTACH_BACKING +
  SET_SCANOUT succeed; the flush pump presents live GDI output
  (TRANSFER_TO_HOST_2D + RESOURCE_FLUSH ~60 Hz).
- Live 2D verified: advancing the LiveCD wizard (keystroke) repaints correctly —
  the flush pump pushes updated GDI output; input works.
- Boot-smoke clean: reaches the GUI, no bugcheck on the COM1 debug log.
- Baseline comparison: without the driver the same device shows QEMU
  "Display output is not active" (no scanout) or falls back to 640x480 VGA.

**Two bring-up bugs found and fixed during testing:**
1. `VideoPortGetBusData` (PCI config) is unreliable during `HwFindAdapter`
   (bus/slot not yet assigned) — it returned zero BARs. Fixed by decoding BARs
   on demand in `Vpw_GetBar` from `HwInitialize` context.
2. For VGA-class devices (`virtio-vga`) `VideoPortGetAccessRanges` reports the
   legacy VGA ranges, not the virtio MMIO BARs, so BAR length lookup missed.
   Since the lib only uses the length as a sanity bound (the real mapping uses
   each capability's own offset/length), `Vpw_GetBar` falls back to the decoded
   BAR base + a generous bound when there is no exact access-range match.

**Remaining gap to a "full" 2D KMD / what GFX-03 builds on:** unchanged from
sections 10 — full-screen flush by default (dirty-rect hooking display driver is
the perf win), contiguous single-entry backing capped at 1080p (SG backing next),
polled (no IRQ/MSI-X fences), software cursor (hardware cursorq later), no EDID.
GFX-03 (3D/virgl) reuses this transport bring-up, controlq submission, the
resource+backing model and scanout; it adds VIRTIO_GPU_F_VIRGL, 3D resources,
context create, SUBMIT_3D and capset negotiation on the same controlq.
