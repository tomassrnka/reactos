/* NOTE: A sleeping thread puts a wait entry on its stack into a FIFO list that hangs off the
   condition variable, and gives up the caller's lock only afterwards. It then sleeps on a keyed
   event whose key is an address inside its own entry, so a wake-up is addressed to one thread.

   A waker takes the entries it wants to wake off the list, under the list lock, and marks them as
   claimed. Only then does it release the keyed event for each entry, with no timeout: the release
   returns when that sleeper has arrived at the keyed event, which a sleeper that registered itself
   under the caller's lock does within a few instructions. A wake-up is not lost when the sleeper
   has not arrived yet, which is where the former release with a zero timeout dropped it.

   A sleeper whose wait ended in a timeout cannot tell from the keyed event alone whether a waker
   claimed it in the meantime: the kernel can report the timeout although a release already paired
   with it. It therefore checks its entry under the list lock. An unclaimed entry is taken off the
   list; a claimed one means that a waker has used a wake-up on this thread, which then reports
   success. The waker's last access to an entry is a flag that it sets when its release has
   returned, and a claimed sleeper does not return, and so does not free its entry, before that.

   Wine's condition variables (a count of sleepers in the variable and one key for all of them) were
   considered and not used: a broadcast then releases the key as often as there were sleepers, and
   a thread that sleeps again at once can take a release that belongs to a sleeper that has not
   arrived yet, which leaves that sleeper asleep. */
